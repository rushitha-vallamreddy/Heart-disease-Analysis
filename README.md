project Update: Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning 🚀
 latest project where I applied machine learning techniques to predict heart disease! 💡❤️

🔍 Objective: Analyze health data to predict the likelihood of heart disease using various patient characteristics (e.g., age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.).

💻 Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and normalized features for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to identify trends, correlations, and key features influencing heart disease.
Feature Selection: Used techniques like correlation matrices and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to choose the most impactful features.
Modeling: Trained multiple models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict heart disease.
Evaluation: Evaluated models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC scores to ensure reliable predictions.
🏆 Results: The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy with [mention your accuracy score here], helping identify key risk factors for heart disease with greater reliability!

This project reinforced my skills in: ✅ Data preprocessing ✅ Model evaluation and selection ✅ Feature engineering and optimization
